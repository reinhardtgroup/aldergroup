        <h2>Napoleon's Rise to Power</h2>
        <p><strong>By </strong><strong><a href="../authors/jfr.html" target="_blank">Joseph F. Reinhardt</a></strong> - April 19, 2025</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Have you ever wondered how Napoleon rose to power? Or how he was able to gain so many victories during the wars? After the french revolution, Napoleon became a famous and successful emperor of France. In his beginning years, Napoleon was a normal boy who gained his education in mainland France and quickly joined the French military and rose the ranks. Over the course of the revolution, Napoleon grew closer to the group of revolutionaries and quickly befriended them. Over time though, Napoleon grew greedy of power within the government and wanted to take power. In a coup attempt on the republic, or Coup d'état of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon took power of the French government and later titled himself Emperor. Ultimately, Napoleon is one of the greatest and most influential military commanders in recent history.</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Napoleon’s early life saw him born in a French territory and he began his career in the military in his early years. Napoleon Bonaparte “Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica” (“Napoleon Bonaparte”).  Napoleon was born into a non-wealthy and large family in which his father was a lawyer. Following Napoleon’s graduation from the military academy, “he then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army” (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon went to a French Military Academy where he graduated and entered the military shortly after as an officer. “The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic” in which Napoleon was given the position of Brigadier General and was close to the heads of the revolution (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon was quickly promoted within the French Army to a General due to his close ties to the heads of the new republic. “In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria”, and due to Napoleon's great efforts and military victories, “in 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French” (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon was the first choice for The Directory’s huge plan for a victory over their rival, Austria, where Napoleon played a key role in France’s gain of territory. Napoleon Bonaparte’s early years included his education in mainland France and his rise in the French Military.</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Napoleon quickly rose to power following his many military victories and amazing leadership shown in his battles and victories and showed great leadership and proved to be a great commander. Because of the loyalty of the French people, “despite defeats in Egypt, Napoleon returned to a hero’s reception” (“The Rise of Napoleon”). Even though Napoleon suffered many defeats during the Egyptian campaign, upon his return he was treated like a hero and he was loved. “The Directory was replaced with a three-member Consulate, and 5'7" Napoleon became first consul, making him France’s leading political figure” effectively giving Napoleon full authority over the French Empire and giving him great power (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Following a coup against the French government, Napoleon was placed as the head of the French government and he later crowned himself as the Emperor of the French Empire. Napoleon Bonaparte was a emperor who built his agenda on war and lead his empire to many victories: “from 1803 to 1815, France was engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, a series of major conflicts with various coalitions of European nations”(“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon Bonaparte led his empire into a decade long war where he was greedy for victories against other European nations and empires. “In October 1805, the British wiped out Napoleon’s fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar” but following that defeat, Napoleon achieved what is considered to be one of his greatest victories at the Battle of Austerlitz” where he defeated the Russians and the Austrians in a major victory which boosted morale (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon led his empire to a huge victory over the Russians and Austrians in the Battle of Austerlitz. Napoleon Bonaparte led his empire to many victories which are unimaginable, the list of major accomplishments and victories goes on.</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Napoleon gained power one last time in an attempt to succeed in his quest as a emperor, but following the final defeat in the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled from France yet again and lived his final years alone. “On April 6, 1814, Napoleon, then in his mid-40s, was forced to abdicate the throne” after he and his empire was ultimately defeated (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon Bonaparte and his empire was defeated after a decade long war and he was exiled from France and forced onto an island. Looking for power in France once again, “on February 26, 1815, after less than a year in exile, Napoleon escaped Elba and sailed to the French mainland with a group of more than 1,000 supporters” (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon decided he was not finished with he conquest against the European nations so he decided to escape from exile and return to france. Napoleon is notorious for his great leadership and extremely smart military tactics, he often attacked his enemies in times in which they were vulnerable: “Napoleon raised a new army and planned to strike preemptively, defeating the allied forces one by one before they could launch a united attack against him” (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). Napoleon Bonaparte created a smart and powerful plan to attack his enemies before they could prepare an attack which proved how smart he was. Following Napoleon’s victorious and masterly planned battles, “on June 18, at the Battle of Waterloo near Brussels, the French were crushed by the British, with assistance from the Prussians” which locked in the defeat of the French Empire (“Napoleon Bonaparte”). In the final battle of the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon and is empire was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo which marked the end of the wars and the defeat of Napoleon. During the late years of the Napoleon Wars, Napoleon Bonaparte struggled to remain and power and remain successful in his conquest in Europe.</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Throughout his reign as the emperor of France during the decade long Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon Bonaparte showed traits of a great leader and excellent victories after quickly rising to power. Napoleon as a young boy went to school in mainland france and entered a military academy and went to the military. Napoleon then went on in the military and gained great victories which assisted in his rise to power. Following his great military victories in his early career, Napoleon Bonaparte returned home to France to supporters and he was a hero. And soon after the directory was replaced by Napoleon and his three member consulate and he started a decade long war. Following is defeat in the decade long Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon Bonaparte  was exiled from France to a remote island. Shortly after being exiled, Napoleon returned to France with support and took over in a last effort to succeed as emperor. Napoleon Bonaparte’s rise to power is one of a excellent and interesting conquest where he showed is power and knowledge in his many victories.</p>
