        <h2>2002 Winter Senatorial Election Exit Polling Data</h2>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">The Alder Media Group presents the following data charts and graphs taken directly from the Google Forms publicly announced over the past three (3) days. Data from this exit poll does not and will not reflect the outcome of an election and is purely based on submissions of participants. Numbers to do reflect the amount of voters in the actual election.</p>
        <p class="bodyparagraph">Due to the participants not exceeding 100, we have decided not to make projections in this election. Instead, we are using these numbers as a trial run. We will compare our data to the election outcomes in hopes that it is accurate. In the event it is inaccurate we will investigate to determine what may have caused the inaccuracy.</P>
